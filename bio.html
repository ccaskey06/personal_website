        <h3>My name is Corey Caskey. I am a second-year Computer Science student at the Georgia Institute of Technology.
          Throughout high school, my interests varied, shifting from Mechanical Engineering to Chemical Engineering and finally,
          Computer Science. My focus in my major is Systems & Architecture and Information Networks. Having come into Computer
          Science only recently, I am looking to find my niche interest(s) in this broad major. Whether by learning various programming
          languages and their applications, or finding campus organizations in CS that spark my interest, or working on projects inside
          and outside of class, I am continuing to grow my knowledge.
        </h3><br />
        <h3>College has also afforded me the chance to expand myself outside of my major. I have become a part of Alpha Kappa Psi
          Business Fraternity, I am a Student Assistant at the College of Computing, and I assist students in Computer Science as
          a tutor. Likewise, I have found my passion for writing, which is something I hope to continue pursuing throughout my time here.
        </h3>
